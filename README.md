To run the single java file I recommend using IntelliJ and simply pressing the run button to run the InMemoryDB.java file.

To make this into an official assignment I feel that the instructions and submission could be more clear. For example it says "4 points for working code" but doesn't specify any further and what would count as "working code".
Should an interactable command line menu be there? Do I have to run specific functions in a certain way? For now I have just ran what was present in figure 2 of the document. If anything I feel that a menu of sorts should be integrated
because this extra credit assignment did not take too long to implement.
